Technical Description of JCRdb (Jena Clinical Research Database) v1.0 
======================================================================

1. Motivation:
--------------

To provide a user-friendly, clean interface for the storage, retrieval, and visualization of multimodal clinical data at the Jena University Hospital.

2. Overview:
------------

The research database is specifically engineered for seamless integration into the desktop workspaces at Jena University Hospital. It features a streamlined, intuitive frontend for user interaction, facilitating the storage, retrieval, and visualization of multimodal clinical data. The backend employs a relational database management system optimized for efficient data handling.

Due to stringent local IT infrastructure constraints, driven primarily by the need to adhere to General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR), the database resides within the secure local network of Jena University Hospital. It is encapsulated in a single SQLite file, ensuring ease of management and high-speed access. User authentication is mandatory for database access, and connections are limited to those originating from within the hospital's local network.

The frontend operates independently from a self-contained folder and requires no installation. To interact with the SQLite database, users must have read and write permissions. Importantly, all data remains securely stored in the backend database, while the frontend serves solely as an access and manipulation tool.

The database is available to a group of staff at the University Hospital of Jena. It is not available to the public. Multiple instances (i.e. database files) can be used to manage different projects independently. The database is designed to be easily extensible, allowing the addition of new data types and functionalities. Data can also be exchanged with other database instances or other systems using a defined HL7 JSON file standard.

The following figure illustrates the principle architecture of the database:

Export and Import of Data
.........................

The database supports the export of data in CSV format and HL7 JSON format. The CSV format is a simple text format that can be opened with any text editor or spreadsheet program. The HL7 JSON format is a standardized format for the exchange of clinical data. The database uses the HL7 JSON format to exchange data with other instances of the database or other systems.

.. NOTE::

   In the Appendix you will find exemplary CSV and HL7 JSON files.

6. Security and Compliance:
---------------------------

In its intended use within the network of the University Hospital Jena, the database is protected by the following security measures
- the database is only available within the local network of the hospital
- the location of the database is shared only within the research study group
- only authorised users have access to the database

The database is designed to be used in a secure environment. It is not recommended to use the database in an unsecured environment. The database is not designed for use in a public environment.

By default, the research database is designed to work with data that is not considered personal data under the GDPR. However, the database may be used to store personal data. In this case, the user is responsible for compliance with the GDPR. The database is not designed for use in a public environment.

7. Integration & Extensibility:
-------------------------------

The UI front-end is a standalone application and can connect to any SQLite database file structured according to the template provided. The database file can be exchanged with other instances of the database or other systems using the HL7 JSON file standard.

There are currently no APIs available for direct interaction with the user interface. However, the database can be accessed directly via SQL queries using the suggested `DB Browser for SQLite` editor: https://sqlitebrowser.org.

8. Testing & Validation:
------------------------

Testing Frameworks:

- Unit Tests: using the Jest Framework (https://jestjs.io/) for testing
   - data import and export
   - CRUD operations on the database
   - CQL rules application
- Integration Tests: using the Cypress Framework (https://www.cypress.io/) for testing
   - UI testing (e.g. data input, data search, data export)

9. Conclusion & Future Work:
-----------------------------

The Research Database is a simple yet powerful tool for storing all types of clinical data in a single place. It is designed to be easily extensible, allowing new data types and functionalities to be added. Data can also be exchanged with other database instances or other systems using a defined HL7 JSON file standard.

The status as is is a first version of the database. It is already in use at the University Hospital of Jena and will be further developed in the future.

*The following features are planned for future releases:*

- Data Visualisation
- Built-in image and RAW data viewer
- Enhanced security and compliance through database file encryption
